    myText: "I could not believe my eyes. I have never seen such a magnificent creature
      in my life. I\u2019m still shaking. Although it was huge, he still seemed vulnerable.
      Like it was hurt in some way. It got scared when he saw the white trail behind
      our boat. I\u2019ve never even noticed the trail. I guess that we\u2019re making
      the same mistake as the cruise ship is making. Even though it is on a much
      smaller scale, the monster still seemed afraid. I guess we have to get rid
      of this old boat and get a cleaner one."
