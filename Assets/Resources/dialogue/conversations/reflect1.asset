      man. I wonder why nobody wants to listen to him. He seemed legit. I also wonder
      what it is he is so afraid of. Could the dying corals really provoke such devastation,
      or is there something else at play? Something bigger? And what about those
      mysterious polyps? They will help me, but won\u2019t solve anything? What does
      that mean? I guess we have no choice but to keep going and find more clues."
