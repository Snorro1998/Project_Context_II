      You know, the thing about the chemical reaction and stuff."

      with us.

    myText: Great idea! We could secretly plant bombs on the boat and threaten to
      detonate them unless the captain speaks with us.

      also ask our new friend here to come with us. He might be able to intimidate
      the captain just enough to squeeze a statement out of there.'

    myText: Alright, that went well. What else could we try? Maybe we can lure him
      somehow?
