      It just wanted to live and flourish again. Too bad that\u2019s never going
      to happen. All this time pointing fingers at each other has only worsened the
      problems at play, instead of improving them. We should listen to what science
      tells us and all take our responsibility. And even though the cruise ship caused
      the emissions, they are only able to sail because of the people that make use
      of them. Apparently there are options that won't harm the corals."
