      ocean and we want to know everything you know about it.

      don\u2019t mind, otherwise they would not make use of my services, would they?
      They all know what\u2019s going on, but still choose to stay here. I\u2019m
      just the supplier. They are to blame, not me."

      corals. Can\u2019t you see that blaming each other only worsened the problems
      instead of improving them? Look at this poor guy, it\u2019s one of the most
      beautiful creations of mother nature. "
