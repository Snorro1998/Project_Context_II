    myText: "Well, that visit only raised more questions. Nana\u2026 she knows about
      the corals and still pretends like nothing is happening. She blamed the captain,
      so apparently she doesn\u2019t feel responsible at all. Is that what the scientists
      meant? Do people know what\u2019s going with the corals, but just choose to
      ignore it? Do they purposely choose luxury over life? And what about that captain.
      She must know something, or else she wouldn\u2019t have treated us that way.
      I will have to come back to her and find out what she knows. We have to find
      a way to persuade her. "
